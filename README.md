# Rise and Fall of Progamming Languages 
Analyze the relative popularity of programming languages over time based on Stack Overflow data.

## Project Description
How can you tell what programming languages and technologies are used by the most people? How about what languages are growing and which are shrinking, so that you can tell which are most worth investing time in? One excellent source of data is Stack Overflow, a programming question and answer site with more than 16 million questions on programming topics. By measuring the number of questions about each technology, you can get an approximate sense of how many people are using it. In this project, you'll use open data from the Stack Exchange Data Explorer to examine the relative popularity of languages like R, Python, Java and Javascript have changed over time.

## Project Tasks
  1. Data on tags over time
  2. Now in fraction format
  3. Has R been growing or shrinking?
  4. Visualizing change over time
  5. How about dplyr and ggplot2?
  6. What are the most asked-about tags?
  7. How have large programming languages changed over time?
  8. Some more tags!
